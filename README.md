# Family Tree

A unique interactive family tree web app with a radial tree and timeline view.

For demonstration purposes, the app uses a sample family tree based on the Roy family from the HBO series Succession.

For members of my family that are present in the tree, they can enter their name and birthdate for view and edit access to family tree data located in the private [Family Tree Data](https://github.com/deanstein/family-tree-data) repo.
