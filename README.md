An unique interactive family tree web app with a radial tree view and a timeline view.

For demonstration purposes, the app uses a sample family tree based on the Roy family from the HBO series Succession can be viewed.

For members of my family that are present in the tree, they can enter their name and birthdate for view and edit access to family tree data located in the private [Family Tree Data](https://github.com/deanstein/family-tree-data) repo.
