# Family Tree

A unique interactive family tree app with a radial tree view, where any person can be shown with their relevant tree:

... as well as a timeline view which can contain events and photos:

For demonstration purposes, the app uses a sample family tree based on the Roy family from the HBO series Succession.

My personal family tree is also available for my family to view and edit, requiring a name and birthdate for authentication.
